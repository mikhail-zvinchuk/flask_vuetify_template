## Template for creating Flask and Vuetify apps

This is created to be a time saver for developing fast prototypes.

It is supposed to be deployed using render, but nothing should stop you from running this anywhere else.

This is not intended to be fast, this is designed to be fast for for development.

Current version should be deployed to the https://flask-vuetify-template.onrender.com/. 

It might take some time for it to load if you get the cold start. 

We are using free tier, so if it is not giving you 502 just wait a little bit.
